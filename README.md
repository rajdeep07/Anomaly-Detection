# Anomaly-Detection
This is my effort on understanding Anomaly Detection and various ML approaches to apply. This is a unique problem in ML where with no targets, we need to identify anomalies. 

Approach:
* Explore - Explained the shape and characteristic of the data. Use visuals to fit and explain the shape of the data. Few insights have also been shared. 
* Feature Engineering - Created new features to build to extend the data set.
* Anomaly Detection using Statistical Model - Applied statistical model to identify to find outliers. [means, box-plots and histograms]
* Anomaly Detection using Clustering - Applied clustering approach to identify anomalies. [kmeans and t-SNE]
* Anomaly Detection using Classification - Applied classification approach to identify anomalies. [KNN, Isolation Forest and One Class SVM]

* Dataset: https://github.com/numenta/NAB/tree/master/data/realKnownCause

I am using ambient temperature system failure dataset for doing anomaly detection.
